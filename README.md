## Merging branches with conflicts

When you're collaborating with others on a git repository, you'll each be working in branches and eventually you'll want to merge them together.

If you've been working on separate pieces of code, git will keep both of your changes and everything will be good.

If you've been working on the same code, you will have to choose which pieces of code to keep and which to discard. This is known as resolving a merge conflict.
